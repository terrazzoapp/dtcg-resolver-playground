This playground features a working example of the [DTCG Resolver Module](https://designtokens.org/TR/2025.10/resolver/).

> [!WARNING]
> This fully matches the spec except it does not support **inline modifiers or sets in `resolutionOrder`.**

## How to use

1. Select a design system from the presets
2. Edit code!
3. Select modifiers on the top right.
4. See the result on the bottom right. The highlighted lines show how your chosen modifiers affected the end result.
